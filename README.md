# IPO-underpricing-ML

The goal of this final project is to determine whether an IPO is underpricing or not. Before diving into the different steps of this project, I wil try to define the concepts related to IPOs. 

IPO (Initial Public Offering) : introduction of a new stock for public trading on a stock exchange. Its purpose it to raise capital for the future growth of the company. Alibaba, Visa and Facebook are among the biggest IPOs of all time (more than $15 billion dollars raised). 

Underpricing : practice of listing an initial public offering (IPO) at a price below its real value in the stock market. When a new stock closes its first day of trading above the set IPO price, the stock is considered to have been underpriced. An IPO may be underpriced deliberately in order to boost demand and encourage investors to take a risk on a new company. It may be underpriced accidentally because its underwriters underestimated the demand in the market for this company's stock. In any case, the IPO is considered underpriced by the difference between its first day closing price and its set IPO price.

Issuer : company that is going public and is issuing shares to the public. 

Underwriter/Manager : investment bank that works with the issuer to take it public. 

Offer Price : price at which a company sells its shares to investors.

Opening Price : price at which the shares begin to trade in the open market. The opening price is set by supply and demand. 

While the offering price of an IPO is the specific price point at which shares are sold to investors, the opening price is the initial value of the share when it begins trading on the public markets.

1st Day Close : closing price for an IPO on the first day it trades on an exchange. 

Star Ratings : score related to a range of potential shares. I will use the 5-Star Rating system.
