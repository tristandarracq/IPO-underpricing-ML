# IPO-underpricing-ML

The goal of this final project is to determine whether an IPO is underpricing or not. Before diving into the different steps of this project, I wil try to define the two main concepts related to this project. 

IPO (Initial Public Offering) : introduction of a new stock for public trading on a stock exchange. Its purpose it to raise capital for the future growth of the company. Alibaba, Visa and Facebook are among the biggest IPOs of all time (more than $15 billion dollars raised). 

Underpricing : practice of listing an initial public offering (IPO) at a price below its real value in the stock market. 


I used traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest...) in order to classify whether an IPO is underpriced or not. One way to dramatically improve the results would be to use ANN.
